# Implement a function that will convert a decimal number to binary,
#  returning a string representation of the binary number. The input is an integer. 

# Your function should implement an algorithm that does the conversion 
# (for example, the division method of conversion).

# (so cant use ruby inbuilt methods)


def decimal_to_binary (decimal)
		# ruby inbuilt method - see other files
	  # divide number by 2 and log remainders?

	# get length of number
	# determine biggest power of 2 that fits into number
	# see keefer and thom solutions - built with remainders maths
